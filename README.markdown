Vibetrace API
=============

This document describes the Vibetrace API which offers clients realtime recommendations based on user events.

Please refer to this document for an up-to-date api documentation and submit your feature requests, bugs or errors in this repo's issue tracker.

General
-------

This document uses the following notations:
 - `app` to specify the client of the Vibetrace API. This is you.
 - `item` to specify the unit that is tracked and/or recommened by our server. This could be a product in an ecommerce site, etc.
 - `user` to specify the user of the app. This could be a shopper on an online store, etc.

The latest version of the api is `v3`. Previous versions will soon be deprecated.

The API closely follows [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) principles and exposes two types of resources: `items` and `events`.

The API base endpoint is `https://app.vibetrace.com/api/v3/apps/:appId/` where `:appId` is the `APP_ID` string received upon registration.

The API data format, both for payloads and responses, is [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json)

Response Types
--------------

Standard HTTP response codes are used:

1. `200 Ok` - returned by successful GET/PUT requests.
2. `201 Created` - returned by succesfull POST requests.
3. `204 No Content` - returned by successfull DELETE requests to show that the resource is now deleted.
4. `400 Bad Request` - returned when a request is badly formatted or has incorrect parameters.
5. `401 Unauthorized` - returned by all http methods when auth credentials are missing or are wrong.
6. `403 Forbidden` - returned by all http methods when the client is authenticated but he does not have access to the requested resource.
6. `404 Not Found` - returned by all http methods when the resource specified in the URI does not exist.
7. `500 Internal Server Error` - returned by all http methods when an error has occured on Vibetrace servers. Please report these errors at [alext@vibetrace.com](mailto:alext@vibetrace.com)

Auth
----

All Vibetrace API traffic must be done via [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Https) and using [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)

An `APP_ID`, `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET` will be generated upon app registration. Keep them safe!

Basic HTTP Authorization is required for most API calls. Make sure you add the following http header to the endpoints that require it:
````
Authorization: Basic aHR0cHdhdGNoOmY=
````
Where `aHR0cHdhdGNoOmY=` is an _example_ of a base64 encoded string formed like so: `API_KEY:API_SECRET`

`401 Unauthorized` Http Error will be returned if the `Authorization` header is not supplied or if it contains incorrect credentials.


Items
-----

`https://app.vibetrace.com/api/v3/apps/:appId/items`

Allows apps to upload/inspect/modify/remove items of interest.

 - `Accept: application/json`
 - usefull to inspect a previously uploaded item
 - for `:itemId` use the `id` specified when the item was created. Note that it's the app's responsability to make sure these id's are accurate. This API will only check for it's uniqueness.
 - if no resource with the specified `:itemId` and a matching `:appId` is found, the response will be `404 Not Found`.
 - if successfull, the response will be `200 Ok` and the payload will be a JSON of the document initially uploaded.

### Check Item
3. `HEAD https://app.vibetrace.com/api/v2/apps/:appId/items/:itemId`

 - usefull for checking if a item identified by `:itemId` exists and belongs to an app identified by `:appId`.
 - this endpoint returns 200 if such an item exists or 404 if it doesn't.
 - _NOTE_ This endpoint does not require HTTP Basic Auth, meaning you can request this resource without authentication.
 - below is an example of using `curl` to issue a HEAD request.

    ````bash
    curl --request HEAD --insecure https://app.vibetrace.com/api/v3/apps/50fc3bb47cfd33723b00000c/items/1

 - `Content-Type: application/json`
 - usefull to updating the properties of an existing item in the Vibetrace Data Store.
 - for `:itemId` use the `id` specified when the item was created. Note that it's the app's responsability to make sure these id's are accurate. This API will only check for it's uniqueness.
 - _NOTE_ you cannot update the id of an item, the `id` property will be ignored. _!You cannot change the id of an item._
 - _NOTE_ when updating the url of an item, make sure it's unique within the domain of items synchronized with vibetrace.
 - if successful, the response will be `200 Ok` and the new resource will be returned as json.
 - accepted payload is similar to the POST request, here's the payload signature:

    ````
    @param {Object} item - the body of the response
    @param {String} [item.name]
    @param {String} [item.category]
    @param {String} [item.url]

    }
    ````

### Delete Item
5. `DELETE https://app.vibetrace.com/api/v3/apps/:appId/items/:itemId`

 - usefull when an item is no longer in the app's collection and should be removed from Vibetrace's recommendation engine.
 - for `:itemId` use the `id` specified when the item was created. Note that it's the app's responsability to make sure these id's are accurate. This API will only check for it's uniqueness.
 - if sucessful, the response will be `204 No Content` to notify the app that the resource no longer exists
 - _NOTE_ For reasons of efficiency, this method does not check if the item exists. If it doesn't it will still return `204 No Content`.
 - below is an example of using `curl` to delete an existing item:

    ````bash
    curl --request DELETE  --user "Cf4S4qrr/OSKzKMl3Tm/NTMECRM=:U1tfKBtyJstc+LqOUem99YkI1hM=" --insecure https://app.vibetrace.com/api/v3/apps/50fc3bb47cfd33723b00000c/items/1
    ````

 - the response payload will be empty


Events
------

`https://app.vibetrace.com/api/v3/apps/:appId/events`

Allows apps to register user's events with Vibetrace and to receive recommendations in real-time based on this and previous events.

App can only _write_ events to Vibetrace, thus only POST endpoints are exposed.

**NOTE** The app is responsable to make sure the information sent to Vibetrace is accurate. Sending inconsistent values will result in poor recommendations. If you encounter dificulties, please contact us at [alext@vibetrace.com](mailto:alext@vibetrace.com)

 - `Accept: application/json`
 - `Content-Type: application/json`
 - registers an `viewItem` event on Vibetrace. Events are unique and immutable.
 - this endpoint requires ID's for current user, session and item. This way Vibetrace keeps track of user sessions and viewed items.
 - the payload is a JSON object with the following signature:

    ````
    @param {Object} payload - the body of the http request should be a JSON object.
    @param {String} [payload.userId] - OPTIONAL, unique identifier for the app's user. Only for registered users. This allows vibetrace to track users' preferences across multiple sessions.
